# Welcome to my dear pet project

### As I was advised once, to have a project that I keep interacting with alongside my growth curve, where I keep adding skills that I learnt, a **Home** you can say or a hobby.

### This project is available **[Here](https://noureldeansaed.github.io/portfolio/)**

### Suggestions are more than welcome, if you would like to see something in particular that isn't online yet, a transition, an animation or anything related to front-end web, then feel free to submit issues to this repo with what you have in mind

### Eventually, if you want to use this repo locally, all you've got to do is

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/NoureldeanSaed/portfolio.git NoureldeanSaedsPet
$ cd NoureldeanSaedsPet
$ npm i
$ npm i live-server -g # Optional if you have got another thing in mind
$ npm run watch
$ npm run dist # In another terminal
```

# Welcome :)
